# FPGA-Arcade-Game-Project
A top-down racing game on Altera FPGA, inspired by Slicks 'n' Slide.

This was the result of a University project to create an arcade game on a FPGA. I played Slicks 'n' Slide as a kid and so was inspired by this.

There will almost definitely be some bugs, as this project was finished after a 22-hour session in the lab getting it to work. I have forgotten what all of the files are for, so I dumped all of them here.
